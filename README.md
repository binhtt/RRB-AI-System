# RRB-AI-System
  Formal Event-B models for correctness preservation under rule evolution in Reactive Rule-Based AI (RRB-AI) systems, including verified refinements and safety invariants.
  
**Overview**
  This repository contains refinement-based Event-B specifications modeling:
  
  Reactive rule execution
  
  Controlled rule evolution
  
  Safety invariant preservation
  
  The models demonstrate how rule adaptation can be formally constrained to maintain correctness guarantees without full re-verification.
